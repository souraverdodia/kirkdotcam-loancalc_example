# LoanCalc
---

This project was written to demonstrate making a financial decision based upon calculations of future interest payments for a car loan. In my case I am attempting to refinance a vehicle with $10182 left in principal being paid down at $400/period. These calculations show that in order to reduce the number of periods, I would need to refinance at 1.8% or lower, and doing so would reduce my total interest paid by just under $250.
